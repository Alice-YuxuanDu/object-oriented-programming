Python 
......

There are a number of different ways of obtaining Python, depending a little on
which operating system your computer runs. The options suggested here are 

Follow the :doc:`FoNS Python instructions <fons:python>`. We will exclusively
use :ref:`virtual environments <fons:python_virtual_environments>` so it doesn't matter at
all whether you use Python from Anaconda or from another source. Mac users
should note, though that the built-in Python will not do, so you should use
either Homebrew or Anaconda.

Git
...

Git is a revision control system. Revision control systems enable you to keep
track of the different versions of a piece of code as you work on them, and to
have these versions on different computers as well as backed up in the cloud. We
will use Git and GitHub classroom as a mechanism for distributing, working with
and submitting code exercises.

.. warning::

    When you come to the assessable programming tests that make up 100% of the
    assessment for this module, the code will be distributed and submitted using
    Git. It is therefore essential that you incorporate Git into your day to day
    workflow so that when you come to the test, it's second nature. You will not
    receive marks for test answers that are not committed and pushed.

Visual Studio Code
..................

Visual Studio Code is a Python-aware Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
This means that it incorporates editing files with other programming features
such as :ref:`debugging`, Git support, and built-in :ref:`terminal
<terminal-vscode>`. Visual Studio Code also provides an incredibly useful remote
collaborative coding feature called Live Share. This will be very useful for
getting remote help from an instructor.
